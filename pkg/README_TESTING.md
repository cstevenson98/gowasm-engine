# Internal Package Testing Guide

## Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
./test.sh
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
./test.sh -c
```

### Run with Verbose Output
```bash
./test.sh -v
```

### Run with Coverage HTML Report
```bash
./test.sh -h
```

### Run with Benchmarks
```bash
./test.sh -b
```

### Run WASM Tests in Browser
```bash
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test ./internal/gameobject -v
```

## Test Coverage by Package

| Package | Coverage | Status | WASM Tests |
|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| input   | 100%     | ✅ Excellent | N/A |
| mover   | 61.8%    | ✅ Good | N/A |
| sprite  | 64.5%    | ✅ Good | N/A |
| types   | 46.7%    | ✅ Acceptable | N/A |
| canvas  | 41.5%    | ✅ Acceptable | N/A |
| gameobject | N/A   | ✅ WASM | ✅ 10 tests |
| **Total** | **54.0%** | **✅ Good** | **✅ Enabled** |

## Test Files

### Unit Tests
- `mover/basic_mover_test.go` - Movement and screen wrapping tests
- `sprite/sprite_test.go` - Sprite animation and UV calculation tests
- `input/input_test.go` - Input state management tests
- `types/types_test.go` - Data structure and type tests
- `gameobject/player_test.go` - Player logic tests (requires js build tag)

### Mock Implementations
- `input/mock_input.go` - Mock input capturer for testing
- `mover/mock_mover.go` - Mock mover for testing
- `sprite/mock_sprite.go` - Mock sprite for testing
- `canvas/mock_canvas.go` - Mock canvas manager (pre-existing)

## Running Specific Package Tests

```bash
# Test input package
go test ./internal/input -v

# Test mover package
go test ./internal/mover -v -cover

# Test sprite package  
go test ./internal/sprite -v -cover

# Test types package
go test ./internal/types -v

# Test with benchmarks
go test ./internal/mover -bench=. -benchmem
```

## WASM Browser Testing

Thanks to [wasmbrowsertest](https://github.com/agnivade/wasmbrowsertest), we can now run tests that require the `js` build tag directly in the browser!

### Setup (Already Done)
```bash
# Install wasmbrowsertest
go install github.com/agnivade/wasmbrowsertest@latest

# Rename to go_js_wasm_exec (Go will automatically use it)
mv $(go env GOPATH)/bin/wasmbrowsertest $(go env GOPATH)/bin/go_js_wasm_exec
```

### Running WASM Tests
```bash
# Run gameobject tests in browser
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test ./internal/gameobject -v

# The tests will automatically run in Chrome/Chromium
# You can see the browser output in the console
```

### What Gets Tested in WASM
- ✅ Player GameObject (10 tests)
- ✅ Input handling logic
- ✅ Velocity calculations
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Integration with mover and sprite

## Understanding Coverage

The 54% overall coverage is appropriate because:
- ✅ **Business logic** (movement, animation, state) = 80-100% covered
- ✅ **WASM code** = Tested in browser via wasmbrowsertest
- ⚠️ **Mock utilities** = 0% covered (by design, not production code)
- ⚠️ **Browser input APIs** = Tested via integration tests
- ⚠️ **WebGPU rendering** = Requires full browser environment

## Test Categories

### ✅ Fully Tested
- Input state management
- Movement calculations
- Screen wrapping
- Sprite animation
- UV coordinate calculation
- Data structures
- Type conversions

### ⚠️ Partially Tested
- Canvas operations (using mocks)
- GameObject behavior (requires js environment)

### ❌ Not Directly Testable
- WebGPU rendering
- Browser keyboard events
- Browser gamepad API
- DOM manipulation

## Writing New Tests

### Example: Testing a New Mover
```go
func TestMyNewMover(t *testing.T) {
    mover := NewMyMover(types.Vector2{X: 0, Y: 0})
    
    mover.Update(1.0)
    
    pos := mover.GetPosition()
    if pos.X != expectedX {
        t.Errorf("Expected X=%f, got %f", expectedX, pos.X)
    }
}
```

### Example: Using Mocks
```go
func TestWithMocks(t *testing.T) {
    mockSprite := sprite.NewMockSprite("test.png", types.Vector2{X: 64, Y: 64})
    mockMover := mover.NewMockMover(types.Vector2{X: 0, Y: 0}, types.Vector2{X: 10, Y: 0})
    
    // Use mocks in your test
    mockMover.Update(1.0)
    pos := mockMover.GetPosition()
    // assertions...
}
```

## Continuous Integration

To integrate with CI/CD:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Run Tests
  run: ./test.sh -c
  
- name: Check Coverage
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1 | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 50.0" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "Coverage is below 50%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Documentation

- `TESTING_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy and approach
- `TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed results and coverage analysis
- `coverage.out` - Generated coverage data (gitignored)

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail with "undefined: X"
- Check if file has `//go:build js` tag
- These files can only be tested in WASM environment

### Coverage seems low
- Check if measuring mock files (they're intentionally not tested)
- Browser-dependent code cannot be directly tested

### Tests are slow
- Use `go test -short` to skip long-running tests
- Consider parallel test execution with `-p` flag

## Future Improvements

- [ ] WASM test harness for js-specific code
- [ ] Engine integration tests
- [ ] Property-based testing
- [ ] Fuzz testing for state management
- [ ] Visual regression tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
