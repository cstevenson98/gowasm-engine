// NominalVoltageV is the swing-bus voltage magnitude used for a generator
// entity's default spec (see defaultBusSpec). 230V matches typical LV
// (low-voltage) single-phase distribution, so a freshly-placed generator
// with no other configuration acts as a 230V reference for the network.
//
// All electrical quantities in this package are real, physical SI units
// (volts, ohms, watts, amps) rather than a normalised per-unit system: since
// P = V·I and Q, P calculations only ever multiply/divide V by V, R, or G,
// staying in consistent SI units throughout is dimensionally sufficient —
// no base MVA/kV choice is required.
