# Cursor AI Development History

This file contains a chronological log of all changes made during AI-assisted development sessions.

**Purpose**: Provide context, reasoning, and audit trail for all modifications.

**Format**: Each entry includes timestamp, changes, reasoning, impact, and testing notes.

## [2025-10-18 20:49:55 BST] - Created Cursor Rules and History System

**Prompt/Request**: Create cursor rules for this game engine project. Include information about WASM in Go (build tags, WebGPU wrapper that minimizes hardcoded JS calls). Also create a history rule that tells agents to log changes for each prompt, always read the history, and always use bash to get timestamps. Each rule should exist as a .mdc file in .cursor/rules/

**Changes Made**:
- Created `.cursor/rules/` directory structure
- Created `gameEngine.mdc` - Comprehensive cursor rule for the Go WASM WebGPU game engine
  - Documented architecture overview (Engine, Canvas, GameObject, Scene, Sprite, Mover, Input, Types)
  - Explained Go build tag pattern (`//go:build js`)
  - Documented WebGPU wrapper usage (cogentcore/webgpu library)
  - Covered testing patterns (unit tests vs WASM browser tests)
  - Added code patterns and examples
  - Included file naming conventions
  - Listed important development rules
  - Added common tasks and debugging guides
- Created `history.mdc` - Change logging rule
  - Defines workflow: always read history first, make changes, log changes
  - Requires bash commands for timestamps (`date` command)
  - Provides entry template and examples
  - Includes automation tips and scripts
- Created `CURSOR_HISTORY.md` - Initial history file with this first entry

**Reasoning**:
The project has a sophisticated architecture using Go compiled to WASM with WebGPU rendering. Key aspects that needed documentation:

1. **Build Tags**: Critical for separating WASM code (with `//go:build js`) from test/mock code. Without understanding this, developers might break the build or tests.

2. **WebGPU Wrapper**: The project uses cogentcore/webgpu to minimize direct syscall/js calls. This is important for maintainability and type safety.

3. **Component Architecture**: The engine follows interfaces and composition patterns that need to be understood for consistent development.

4. **History System**: Provides continuity across AI sessions, creates an audit trail, and helps understand past decisions.

**Impact**:
- Future AI sessions will have context about the project architecture
- Developers will understand build tag requirements
- Changes will be consistently logged with timestamps
- Better code consistency following established patterns
- Easier debugging by tracking when changes were made

**Testing**:
- Verified directory structure created successfully
- Confirmed `.mdc` files are properly formatted markdown
- Verified timestamp generation with bash `date` command works correctly
- Files are in expected locations:
  - `/home/conor/dev/goFE/webgpu-triangle/.cursor/rules/gameEngine.mdc`
  - `/home/conor/dev/goFE/webgpu-triangle/.cursor/rules/history.mdc`
  - `/home/conor/dev/goFE/webgpu-triangle/CURSOR_HISTORY.md`

**Notes**:
- The gameEngine.mdc includes extensive examples of build tag usage, WebGPU patterns, and component interfaces
- The history.mdc enforces using bash for timestamps to ensure consistency and proper timezone handling
- This history file should be updated after every significant change or prompt
- Cursor should automatically load these rules for context in future sessions
- The glob patterns in the .mdc frontmatter define when each rule is active
